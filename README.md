👋 About Me

I’m a Senior Frontend Engineer with 9+ years of experience designing and building scalable, performant, and data-driven applications. I enjoy transforming complex requirements into clean, intuitive UIs that deliver measurable business impact. My work bridges product design, frontend architecture, and developer experience — with a strong focus on React, TypeScript, and modern build systems.

🔭 What I’m Working On

🧠 Smart Study Workflow (WIP)
An AI-assisted note-to-flashcard workflow that turns handwritten notes into interactive quizzes and spaced repetition cards using n8n for automation and Claude Code for natural language processing. The goal: enhance learning recall through automated knowledge loops.

📊 BFA Dashboard
A data visualization dashboard built with Chart.js and React, surfacing key performance metrics and enabling real-time insight generation. Focused on accessibility, reusability, and modular architecture.

🧩 Frontend Patterns & System Design Notes
A living documentation repo covering frontend architecture patterns, including state management, caching, accessibility, and performance — distilled from real-world production experience.

🎙️ Browser Recorder Toolkit
Exploring browser APIs like RecordRTC and Web Audio API to capture and analyze user sessions, aimed at improving UX insights and debugging workflows.

🛠️ Focus Areas

Frontend Engineering – React, TypeScript, Next.js, Angular, Tailwind, GraphQL
Architecture & Design – Component systems, scalability, performance tuning
Developer Experience – CI/CD, monitoring, testing, design systems
Data Visualization – Chart.js, D3, analytics dashboards
AI-Powered Workflows – n8n, OpenAI SDK , Claude API integrations

🌱 Currently Exploring
