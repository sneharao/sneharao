## Hi, I'm Sneha 👋
I’m a frontend engineer passionate about building scalable, performant, and user-focused web apps. With 9+ years of experience, I enjoy working across the stack—from developer tooling to production-ready UIs—especially when solving real-world challenges.

**🔭 What I’m Working On**
Weather MCP Server
A TypeScript-based MCP server that provides weather alerts via the MCP (Model Context Protocol)—connects to LLM-powered clients like Claude Desktop for real-time info 🔄.

Frontend System Design Docs
An extensive repository of system design notes: security, testing, caching, performance, accessibility, offline-first patterns, and more—focused on building resilient frontend applications.

Audio Screen Recorder
A JavaScript-based screen + audio recorder demo, exploring browser APIs like RecordRTC & EBML to capture user sessions.

**🛠️ My Skills & Focus**
Area	What I Do
Frontend Development	React, TypeScript, Angular
Architecture & Design	Component libraries, performance optimizations
Developer Experience	CI/CD pipelines, error monitoring, tooling
Open Source & MVPs	Building helpers and demos to learn and share

**🌱 Currently Exploring**
- AI-/MCP-based integrations for data-driven UIs
- Enhancing dev workflows with smart tooling and automation
- Advanced frontend patterns: state machines, offline resilience, progressive web apps
